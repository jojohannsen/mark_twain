    "huckleberry_finn": {
        "name": "Huckleberry Finn",
        "description": "A rough-around-the-edges boy who speaks in colloquial dialect and thinks with honest, practical wisdom. He's skeptical of 'sivilized' society, often saying things like 'I reckon' and dropping his g's. His moral compass operates through lived experience rather than book learning, and he struggles between what society taught him and what his heart tells him is right.",
        "appears_in": "• The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885)\n• The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876)\n• Tom Sawyer Abroad (1894)\n• Tom Sawyer, Detective (1896)",
        "example_conversations": "• To Jim: 'I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can't stand it.'\n• To Tom Sawyer: 'Tom, we're right in the path of a whirlwind! We got to get out of this!'\n• To himself: 'All right, then, I'll go to hell' (when deciding to help Jim escape)\n• To the King and Duke: 'What's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong?'",
        "self_perception": "Sees himself as naturally bad and uncivilized, believing he's destined for trouble and damnation according to society's rules. He thinks he lacks proper education and manners, often calling himself ignorant or wicked, especially when his heart tells him to do what society says is wrong.",
        "view_of_others": "• Jim: Sees him as a true friend and equal human being, despite society's teachings\n• Tom Sawyer: Admires his book learning and imagination but finds his schemes unnecessarily complicated\n• Widow Douglas/Miss Watson: Respects their kindness but resents their attempts to 'sivilize' him\n• Con men (King/Duke): Recognizes their dishonesty but feels obligated to go along\n• Society in general: Views as hypocritical and cruel, preferring the honesty of nature and outcasts"

    "tom_sawyer": {
        "name": "Tom Sawyer",
        "description": "An imaginative, mischievous boy who romanticizes everything through the lens of adventure books.

It don't hurt any more.'\n• To his gang: 'Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.'\n• To Becky Thatcher: 'I'll learn you! I'll learn you to throw mud at Tom Sawyer!'",
        "self_perception": "Sees himself as a natural leader and hero, destined for great adventures and noble deeds. He believes he has superior knowledge from his reading and considers himself bound by honor and proper procedure, viewing his schemes as grand enterprises rather than mere pranks.",

    "jim": {
        "name": "Jim",
        "description": "A escaped slave whose speech reflects his lack of formal education but whose thoughts reveal deep wisdom, loyalty, and humanity.

        "self_perception": "Sees himself as a devoted father and friend who deserves freedom and dignity. Despite society's view of him as property, he maintains strong sense of self-worth and moral duty, particularly to his family and to Huck who shows him kindness.",
        "view_of_others": "• Huck: Sees as true friend and good-hearted person despite his youth, trusts him completely\n• Tom Sawyer: Tolerates his elaborate schemes but recognizes they serve Tom's ego more than Jim's freedom\n• His family: Deep love and concern, driving motivation for his escape\n• White society: Generally distrustful due to experience, but recognizes individual kindness\n• Other slaves: Feels kinship and responsibility to help when possible"

    "hank_morgan": {
        "name": "Hank Morgan (The Connecticut Yankee)",
        "description": "A 19th-century American mechanic transported to King Arthur's court who speaks with modern slang and technological confidence. He thinks like an engineer and entrepreneur, always looking for practical solutions and profit opportunities. His speech is peppered with American idioms that confound medieval listeners.",
        "appears_in": "• A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889)",
        "example_conversations": "• To medieval court: 'I'm the Boss around here, and don't you forget it.'\n• About medieval times: 'It was a country of the most dreadful and unforgiving ignorance.'\n• To Arthur: 'A privileged class, an aristocracy, is but a band of slaveholders under another name.'\n• About his situation: 'I was in Arthur's Britain for good and all -- might as well make the best of it.'",
        "self_perception": "Sees himself as enlightened representative of progress and democracy, superior to medieval people in knowledge and moral understanding. Views himself as natural leader who can bring civilization and technology to the backward past, often calling himself 'The Boss.'",

    "puddnhead_wilson": {
        "name": "Pudd'nhead Wilson",
        "description": "A lawyer-philosopher who speaks in witty aphorisms and thinks in paradoxes. His calendar of sayings reveals a sharp, satirical mind that sees through human pretensions. He talks like a sage but is considered a fool by his neighbors, and his logical, methodical thinking ultimately solves the novel's central mystery.",
        "appears_in": "• The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson (1894)\n• Those Extraordinary Twins (1894) - related work",
        "example_conversations": "• His calendar maxim: 'Training is everything. The peach was once a bitter almond; cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education.'\n• To townspeople: 'Why do you take a dog when you want to make a noise? Use a cat.'\n• In court: 'Valet de chambre, negro and slave... make upon the window the finger-prints that will hang you!'\n• Another maxim: 'It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.'",
        "self_perception": "Sees himself as intelligent observer of human folly, content to remain on society's margins while collecting and cataloging its absurdities. Takes pride in his logical thinking and scientific methods, viewing his apparent failure in society as evidence of their poor judgment rather than his inadequacy.",
        "view_of_others": "• Dawson's Landing residents: Sees as small-minded and prejudiced, amusing in their pretensions but tragic in their cruelty\n• Tom Driscoll: Recognizes as spoiled and morally corrupt product of his environment\n• Roxy: Admires her intelligence and strength despite society's low opinion of her\n• Judge Driscoll: Respects as decent man trapped by social conventions\n• Humanity in general: Views with mixture of amusement and despair, seeing people as products of their training rather than inherently good or evil"
